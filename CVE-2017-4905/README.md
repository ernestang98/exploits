# CVE-2017-4906 + CVE-2017-????

VMware 12.5.4 guest-to-host escape. Chained an information disclosure + undisclosed UaF bug to achieve remote execution (OffSec's Advanced Windows Exploitation Course Case Study). I won't get into the details of the exploit since the below references have already done a pretty good job in understanding the vulnerability as well as walking through the entire process of creating the exploit.

### To Do

- I think it is possible to write the exploit in python as per this article by [ZDI](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2017/8/1/pythonizing-the-vmware-backdoor)

- I did not study the VMware internals and only made use of the existing communication codes done up by rip1s to write the entire exploit, but for individuals interested in hypervisor/vm exploitation, it may be useful to dive into this topic :)
