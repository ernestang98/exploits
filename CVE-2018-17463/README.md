# CVE-2018-17643

`V(CreateObject, Operator::kNoWrite, 1, 1)` indicates CreateObject operation will not have any observable side effects. However, certain operations CAN have obseraveble side effects (e.g. if map has been changed). If these operations that have an obserable side effect are not correctly identified, then they may be removed during the various optimisation phases (such as redundancy elimination).
