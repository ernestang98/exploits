# Property Access & Inline Caching

- Inline caching speeds up propety access

- Ignition Interpreter collects data for function run which is used by TurboFan to generate optimized machine code

- Object map stores many important information such as memory layout of object. If 2 objects have similar structures, they will have similar maps and hence the way their propeties are accessed will be similar enough for v8 to optimise

- Read more here on inline caching: [JavaScript engine fundamentals: Shapes and Inline Caches](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/shapes-ics), [super inline caching](https://v8.dev/blog/fast-super), [Short and seemingly useless article on inline caching](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/v8-engine-and-inline-caching-in-javascript-fef80054a551)

- There are 2 kinds of properties: keyed and named (think of a[1] vs a.x)

- Bytecode generation for is handled by various IGNITION_HANDLERs: IGNITION_HANDLER calls LoadIC_BytecodeHandler which then generates bytecode based on feedback collected thus far. For property access bytecode generation:

    1. If the function is being called for the first time and hence has no feedback, then the bytecode generated and run will be the inefficient property access

        > In the meantime, feedback is collected and optimized property access handlers **for that particular object's map** are cached

    2. If not, the LoadIC_BytecodeHandler will try to find for cached optimized property access handler

        > If it is not found/or somehow the the propety access fails, then v8 will report cache miss and use inefficient property access 

        > If it found then use cached optimized property access handler

# Refresher on super()

- Extends is used to denote the parent class that the child class will inherit its methods from, and super is used to reference the parent classes constructor method as per this [article](https://dev.to/mconner89/creating-child-classes-using-super-and-extends-o0i)

- Use [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_class_extends) example to play around with it
