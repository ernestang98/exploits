### CVE-2023-33693

There is a SEH overflow vulnerability caused by using unsafe strcpy() function in xmlconfig.cpp file in the LoadConfig() function which loads the URL parameter from config file EasyPlayerPro.xml and may result in a SEH/Stack Buffer Overflow. A simple fix to this is to replace strcpy() with strncpy() and set a fix length for the URL field at 256. This ensures that tsingsee/EasyPlayerPro all versions v3.2.19.0106 and v3.6.19.0823 is not vulnerable to a SEH overflow, mainly caused by the usage of unsafe strcpy() function in xmlconfig.cpp file LoadConfig() function, where strcpy() is used to copy over the user controlled URL field in EasyPlayerPro.xml.
